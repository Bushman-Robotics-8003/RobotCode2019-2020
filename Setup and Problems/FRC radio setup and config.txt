In order to setup the FRC radio, you need to first have the "FRC Radio Configuration Utility" installed as well
as "Java Runtime Engine" (JRE)

Once FRC radio configuration utility is installed run it and do the following:
    1) Select "Ethernet" from the dropdown then click "OK"
    2) Put the four digit team number in the "Team Number" box
    3) Make sure the "Radio" box says "OpenMesh"
    4) select "2.4GHz Access Point" from the "Mode" dropdown
    5) Leave all other box as their defualt
    6) Make sure FRC radio is NOT plugged into the computer or a power source
    7) Click the "Load Firmware" button
    8) Wait for the dialog box to give three instructions
    9) Once you see the instructions plug the ethernet cord into the FRC radio in the port next to the power port
    10) Plug the other end of the ethernet cord into the computer
    11) plug the power cord into the FRC radio
    12) The dialog box should recognize the radio after a few seconds, from here just wait until the dialog box says
        something along the lines of "Firmware installed successfully"
    13) Once you see that message click ok and then click the Configure button
    14) This process should take about 1 minute and does not require any user input
    15) Once the dialog box says something along the lines of "Configuration complete", the FRC radio is not configured and 
        ready to be used

Once the FRC radio is configured:
    1) Now you need to give the RoboRIO a static IP address, this is basically a way of identifying the RoboRIO
    2) Connect the RoboRIO to the computer via USB
    3) Once the driver station shows green next to communications open a browser
    4) In the address bar type "172.22.11.2" and press enter, This should bring you to a configuration page for the RoboRIO
    5) This should bring you to a configuration page for the RoboRIO
